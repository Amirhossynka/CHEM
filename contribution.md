Sure, here is some content for a CONTRIBUTING.md file for a Python project:

## Contributing 

Here are some instructions on how to contribute:

1. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.**

    The first step is to create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies from your system. You can do this using the following command:

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    Once the virtual environment is created, you need to activate it:

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Then, you need to install the project's dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Fork the repo.**

    The next step is to fork the project repository on GitHub. You can do this by clicking on the "Fork" button on the repository's page.

3. **Clone your fork.**

    Once you have forked the repository, you need to clone your fork to your local machine. You can do this using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git
    ```

4. **Create a branch.**

    Now, you need to create a branch for your changes. You can do this using the following command:

    ```
    git checkout -b <my-branch>
    ```

5. **Make changes.**

    Once you have created a branch, you can start making changes to the code. Make sure to test your changes before you commit them.

6. **Add and commit your changes.**

    Once you are satisfied with your changes, you need to add them to the staging area and commit them. You can do this using the following commands:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```

7. **Push your changes to your fork.**

    Once you have committed your changes, you need to push them to your fork. You can do this using the following command:

    ```
    git push --set-upstream origin <my_branch>
    ```

8. **Open a pull request.**

    The final step is to open a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository. You can do this by going to the repository's page on GitHub and clicking on the "New Pull Request" button.

In your pull request, be sure to:

* Explain the changes you made.
* Provide screenshots or videos if necessary.
* Request a review from one or more contributors.
